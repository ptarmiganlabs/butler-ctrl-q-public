   Current and past versions are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-control-q-public/releases) section.
2. It contains the public [bug/issues/feature request tracker](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-control-q-public/issues).
3. It provides a [discussion forum](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-control-q-public/discussions) in which you can ask questions, describe ideas for new features etc.


Butler Control-Q can be freely downloaded from this site. 
When started it will go into trial mode.  

Once trial mode ends some parts of the app will become limited and only show part of the data retrived from Qlik Sense Enterprise.
